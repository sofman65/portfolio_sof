              With a deep-seated passion for Time Series Anomaly Detection using Deep Learning, I have dedicated my
              academic and professional career to mastering the intricacies of Artificial Intelligence. As an
              Electrical and Computer Engineer, my quest for knowledge and innovation is reflected in my rigorous
              research and practical application of computational methodologies to unravel complex data anomalies.
            
            
              My academic work, crowned by a Master’s thesis on “Anomaly Detection in Time Series Sensor Data using
              Statistical and Machine Learning Techniques,” marked the beginning of an enduring journey into the realm
              of machine learning and statistical analysis. Currently, as a Ph.D. candidate, I am advancing my research
              in "Deep Learning for Time Series Anomaly Detection in Subsequences," aspiring to contribute
              groundbreaking solutions in anomaly detection.
            
            
              The practical applications of my expertise are complemented by my tenure as a Data Engineer Intern and an
              Application Developer, where I have honed my skills in database schema design, exploratory data analysis,
              and the development of robust machine learning models.
